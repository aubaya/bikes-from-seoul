<h1>About this blog</h1>

<p>I am a motorcycle rider splitting his time between northern Québec and Seoul. I'm not a native English speaker, nor a native Korean speaker.</p>

<p>When I first visited Korea, I realized that the motorcycling landscape is very different from what I am used to in Canada. I'm starting this blog in an attempt to document all the motorcycle related things I encounter in Korea: cool or unusual motorcycles (in my point of view), the riding culture, cool spots to visit or the differences I experience between riding in Canada versus riding in Korea. </p>

<p>Occasionally, I might post a thing or two about life in Canada. Snowmobiling, off-road motorcycling, travelling to/from Korea, etc.</p>

<p>If you want to get in touch, share a cool spot to ride or tell me how bad I'm wrong, you can reach me at the email listed in the footer.</p>

<p>Rock n' roll,<br/>
오바야</p>
