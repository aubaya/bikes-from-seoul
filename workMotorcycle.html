<h1>Work motorcycle, part 1</h1>

<p><div class="figure"><a href="assets/work-motorcycle.jpg"><img src="assets/imagePreviews/work-motorcycle.jpg" alt="A work motorcycle based on a Daelim bike." /></a><em class="figcaption">A work motorcycle based on a Daelim bike.</em></div></p>

<p>I've seen lots of motorcycles that were fitted with a rear rack like this one, although this one seems to have had its seat removed to make way for the rack. Notice also the rear suspension setup. Two more shocks were added to stiffen the rear of the bike when carrying loads. I highly doubt this came like this from the factory.</p>

<p>The engine bay is relatively empty. A quick search makes me believe this was originally a Daelim VS 125, which if true confirms my suspicion that the bike originally had a vertical engine, but was swapped with a smaller horizontal powerplant at some point. The airbox / carburetor configuration is also unusual, most of the horizontal engines I have seen have their airbox and carburetor tucked back, instead of facing forward like on this bike. Maybe it works as a ram air intake? ;)</p>

<p>The rear motorcycle stand is also quite interesting. I didn't get a good look to see how it is made, but zooming on the picture, it looks like it is permanently attached to the bike. It seems like a good location to put it, to better support the cargo when unloading it. But I can't help wondering: since this bike does not seem to have a regular sidestand, it must be quite annoying to lift the rear of the motorcycle by yourself, when it is fully loaded and there is no one to help you.</p>
