<h1>Work motorcycle, part 2</h1>

<p><div class="figure"><a href="assets/work-motorcycle-2-1.jpg"><img src="assets/imagePreviews/work-motorcycle-2-1.jpg" alt="Another motorcycle based on a Daelim." /></a><em class="figcaption">Another motorcycle based on a Daelim.</em></div></p>

<p>This is another example of Korean ingenuity. It looks like the rear of the bike was chopped off to make place to what I can only assume is a homemade cargo box. I didn't take a picture of what is underneath the cargo box, but it seems to be built just like a rear wheel drive small truck, with a driveshaft and a rear differential.</p>

<p>The Daelim motorcycle this vehicle is based on has a transversally mounted engine. Usually, when changing the axis of the power transmission is needed, some kind of gearbox is used (usually bevel gears), this is what you find on modern driveshaft driven motorcycles. However, in this motorcycle's case, the whole engine was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise to align the output of the transmission shaft to the driveshaft.</p>

<p><div class="figure"><a href="assets/work-motorcycle-2-2.jpg"><img src="assets/imagePreviews/work-motorcycle-2-2.jpg" alt="The single-cylinder engine rotated counterclockwise to align with the driveshaft." /></a><em class="figcaption">The single-cylinder engine rotated counterclockwise to align with the driveshaft.</em></div></p>

<p>Rotating the engine also required some other aspects of the bike to be modified:
- The shift lever was relocated and connected to the gearbox using an impressive linkage system
- The exhaust pipe was changed to direct the exhaust gases to the "new" back of the motorcycle
- A sheet metal guard was added around the exhaust pipe to prevent the rider's left leg to be cooked
- The airbox was replaced with some kind of foam brick acting as an air filter (see first picture)</p>

<p>The second picture also showcases how <strong>heavily</strong> the frame was altered. I refered to the rear of the motorcycle as being chopped off earlier, but not much of the front of the motorcycle is left untouched either, at least under the gas tank. Over the gas tank, a roof was added along with a plexiglass windshield. There is also some wind protection for the legs, for comfort during the colder months in spring or fall. I wouldn't be surprised if this motorcycle was also used during winter.</p>
